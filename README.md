Welcome to my GitHub! 🌌

👋 Hi, I'm a teen from India passionate about the magic of midnight and the mysteries of computing. I love delving into CPU architecture, tinkering with circuits, and bringing ideas to life through drawing and animation. Programming is not just a skill for me—it's a playground where I experiment and innovate.

🌙 In the digital silence of night, where dreams and data blur,
💻 Love courses through our circuits, a software we can't deter.
🌟 It lights our souls like screens, then leaves us in the dark,
❤️ A program running on a loop, in binary beats our heart.

🔍 Exploring the vast universe of code, I believe every click in my projects is a step towards destiny. Here, you'll find my experiments, my dreams downloaded at midnight, fleeting yet profound. Each project is a piece of my journey, a part of the dream I dare to live out loud.

👾 Choice but an illusion, a dropdown menu vast,
🛠 Yet every click's predestined, in the code of fate it's cast.
💤 Dreams download at midnight, fleeting as they seem,
✨ Only in the shutdown, do we truly dare to dream.

🚀 Join me as I navigate the enchanting realm of bytes and beliefs—where every line of code is a verse in the epic of creation.
