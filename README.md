  <p>🔍 Exploring the vast universe of code, I believe every click in my projects is a step towards destiny. Here, you'll find my experiments, my dreams downloaded at midnight, fleeting yet profound. Each project is a piece of my journey, a part of the dream I dare to live out loud.</p>

  <p>👾 Choice but an illusion, a dropdown menu vast,<br>
  🛠 Yet every click's predestined, in the code of fate it's cast.<br>
  💤 Dreams download at midnight, fleeting as they seem,<br>
  ✨ Only in the shutdown, do we truly dare to dream.</p>
