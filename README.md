  <h1>BLUE_CLOUDS</h1>

  <p>👋 hello,I'm a teenager who loves tinkering with electronics,ranging froom delving into cup-architecture to making a custom game engine. this github page mainly covers my progress in this dream of a world.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>🌙 In the digital silence of night, where dreams and data blur,<br>
  💻 Love courses through our circuits, a software we can't deter.<br>
  🌟 It lights our souls like screens, then leaves us in the dark,<br>
  ❤️ A program running on a loop, in binary beats our heart.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>🔍 Exploring the vast universe of code, I believe every click in my projects is a step towards destiny. Here, you'll find my experiments, my dreams downloaded at midnight, fleeting yet profound. Each project is a piece of my journey, a part of the dream I dare to live out loud.</p>

  <p>👾 Choice but an illusion, a dropdown menu vast,<br>
  🛠 Yet every click's predestined, in the code of fate it's cast.<br>
  💤 Dreams download at midnight, fleeting as they seem,<br>
  ✨ Only in the shutdown, do we truly dare to dream.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>🚀 Join me as I navigate the enchanting realm of bytes and beliefs—where every line of code is a verse in the epic of creation.</p>
